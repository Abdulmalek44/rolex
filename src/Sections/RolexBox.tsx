                        Every Rolex is delivered in a beautiful presentation box that is both protector and keeper of the
                        jewel that nests inside it. As the presentation box is also a symbol of giving, it is important to us,
                        if you are purchasing a gift, that the recipientâ€™s first contact with their Rolex sets the stage for
                        revealing what lies within.
